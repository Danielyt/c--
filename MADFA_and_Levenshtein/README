Builds a minimal acyclic deterministic automaton from a lexicographically sorted list of words,
then builds a deterministic automaton that recognizes all words within Levenshtein distance
of 1 from the initial list. You need to provide the alphabet the list is written in before compilation.
The alphabet is given on line 21 in file project.cpp. The text file with the words is a command line
parameter.
